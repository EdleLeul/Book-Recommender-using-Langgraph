#📚 Book-Recommender-using-Langgraph
 This project is a tool designed to help readers choose their next book. It takes a raw list of books you want to read, automatically organizes them by genre, and provides evocative, mood-based recommendations for each category. It will ask the user to input book titles line by line until the list is done and the user types "done". It will then arrange the books into different genre and recommends based on what the book's general mood is.

Important Disclaimer
This is my first project using Python, LangGraph, and Pydantic. The majority of the code structure was generated with the help of an AI language model.
